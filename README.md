# Libcore



**Licore** is a C framework, starting as an alternative to `libc`, focused on providing:

- Custom memory allocator
- printf and IO utilities
- String manipulation
- Math functions
- Thread-safe operations
- Extensible modules for future development

>  Currently in early development. Still learning, but aiming to evolve into a full-fledged C framework.
